## Dataset Description

The ClonedPerson dataset is generated by [MakeHuman](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/) and [Unity3D](https://unity.com/). Characters in this dataset use an automatic approach to directly clone the whole outfits from real-world person images to virtual 3D characters, such that any virtual person thus created will appear very similar to its real-world counterpart. The dataset contains 887,766 synthesized person images of 5,621 identities. 3D characters and their counterparts in this dataset are shown in Fig. 1.

The filenames are encoded as follows. Take "700000_s02_c00_f023389.jpg" as an example,
*  700000 is the id of the person
*  s02   is the id of the scene
*  c00   is the id of the camera
*  f023389   is the number of frames

## Experimental Results

By training person re-identification models on these synthesized person images, we demonstrate that the model trained on ClonedPerson has a better generalization performance, superior to that trained on other popular real-world and synthetic person re-identification datasets.. The experimental results are shown in the following tables.
